          Biggest Cause of Exhaust System Failures
        </h1>
        <p className="intro-paragraph">
          Rust is the biggest cause and it usually works from the inside out. A
          mixture of water and sulphuric acid in exhaust gases corrode pipes and
          the internal baffling of the muffler barrel. Vehicles used for short
          journeys, tend to corrode their exhaust systems more quickly. In this
          case, the muffler does not reach high enough temperatures to 'dry
          out', leaving the water and acid to accelerate the rusting process.
          The complete exhaust system is particularly susceptible to damage and
          wear from the outside environment. Underneath the vehicle, it is
          exposed to stones, dirt, water, spills and other road hazards. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          It really does have a tough life. A failing exhaust system will affect
          your vehicle's performance and you will want to arrange an exhaust
          repair or replacement to rectify the issue. To arrange for an
          inspection of your exhaust system phone your nearest Vroom.
