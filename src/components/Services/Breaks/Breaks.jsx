          Vroom offers a comprehensive brake service to make sure your braking
          systems are working optimally for safety and vehicle performance. Car
          brakes are one of the most important vehicle systems so regular brake
          repair and maintenance work is essential. Whether it's new brake pads,
          brake discs, brake drums, a brake service, or a handbrake service
          we've got you covered. To get a car brake system check, visit your
          nearest Vroom branch.

          Brake System Danger Signs

          <li>When your car's brakes screech or squeal</li>
          <li>When your brake pedal is low, hard, soft or spongy</li>
          <li>When your steering wheel shudders under braking</li>
          <li>When your vehicle loses grip under braking</li>
          <li>When your vehicle pulls to the left or right under braking</li>

          Brakes represent one of the most important systems on a car.
          Downsizing of vehicles, aerodynamics and front-wheel drive have
          combined to make brakes smaller, more precise and less tolerant of
          inaccurate service - get a brake service to ensure that your brakes
          are performing properly. It is essential that your car brakes are in
          proper working order at all times. If you can't stop quickly and
          efficiently, you and your family are seriously at risk of having an
          accident. All cars have one of two types of braking systems or a
          combination of both.

        <p className="intro-paragraph">
          Brake fluid is hygroscopic, namely it can absorb moisture from air
          depending on humidity. The amount absorbed indirectly affects brake
          fluid boiling point.
        </p>
        <ol className="intro-paragraph">
          <li>250°C at the beginning (when new)</li>
          <li>200°C after 4 months (moisture 1%)</li>
          <li>150°C after 10-12 months (moisture 3%)</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="intro-paragraph">
          When brake fluid starts absorbing moisture and the boiling point of
          the fluids begins to drop, braking efficiency deteriorates to a point
          where damage to rubber moving parts and low boiling points, cause
          sudden brake failure e.g. prolonged use of brakes when descending a
          hill or driving through a series of tight bends where constant brake
          application is required.
