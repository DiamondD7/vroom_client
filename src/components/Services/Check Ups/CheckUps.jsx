          Today more than ever, safety is a main concern for everyone. Here at
          Vroom we recognise this need for safety. We can provide you with a
          FREE safety check and report for your car at any of our Vroom
          branches. To arrange for a FREE safety check simply phone your nearest
          Vroom or make a booking online. Please note our Free Safety Check does
          not constitute or is a substitute for a Warrant of Fitness check.
