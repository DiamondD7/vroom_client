            Brakes represent one of the most important systems on a car.
            Downsizing of vehicles, aerodynamics and front-wheel drive have
            combined to make brakes smaller, more precise and less tolerant of
            inaccurate service - get a brake service to ensure that your brakes
            are performing properly. It is essential that your car brakes are in
            proper working order at all times. If you can't stop quickly and
            efficiently, you and your family are seriously at risk of having an
            accident. All cars have one of two types of braking systems or a
            combination of both.
