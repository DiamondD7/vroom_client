          Vrooms's suspension and shock absorber services caters for a wide
          range of car suspension and shock absorber types, including standard
          shock absorbers, gas shocks, heavy duty shock absorbers for 4x4 and
          commercial vehicles and air adjustable shock absorber units. In
          addition to just shock absorbers, we service a variety of car
          suspension components including stabilizer bars and suspension
          springs. Vroom's suspension and shock absorber services are available
          from all NZ Vroom service centres so if you are looking at new shock
          absorbers or suspension repairs find your nearest Vroom store

        <h1>Why is it Important to Check Your Suspensions?</h1>
        <ol className="intro-paragraph">
          <li>
            A vehicle with defective shock absorbers can take as much as 2.6
            metres extra to stop in an emergency - perhaps the difference
            between driving past an accident or being in one!
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor handling as a result of vehicle suspension issues can put you
            and your family at serious risk of having an accident
          </li>
          <li>
            Shock absorbers are vital for positive steering and safe braking
          </li>
          <li>
            Shock absorbers smooth out bumps, jolts and give stability for
            comfortable cruising at all speeds and the secure feeling of having
            all four wheels firmly on the ground
          </li>

        <h1 className="intro-opening">Other Repairs</h1>
        <p className="intro-paragraph">
          Vroom also service other parts of the vehicle suspension such as
          stabiliser bars and springs. Springs for towing or for lowering
          vehicle heights are a specialty. To arrange for an inspection of your
          suspension phone your nearest Vroom.
